### SCRATCH PAD: DEVELOPMENT NOTES

1. Installed initial framwork using Reactjs create-react-app: https://create-react-app.dev/docs/getting-started/.

1. To use a .env file, must run "yarn build", then "npm start" or "serve -s build" to serve the resulting build.

1. At this point, the assumption will be made that every table will have a primary key/id column (_idKey).

1. Not every table will have a primary searchable text column.

1. Use a Map?: key value --> position (array of maps?)

// TODO: WHY DO I NEED TO "STRINGIFY" A RESPONSE THAT IS ALREADY "STRINGIFIED" BY THE API??
// document.getElementById("messageboard").value = JSON.stringify(data,null,2);
// TODO: EXAMINE ALL METHODS IN APPFUNCTIONS.JS FOR CONSISTENCY
